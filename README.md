# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website where you can explore my projects, and get in touch. Built with modern frontend technologies, focusing on clean design and smooth user experience. This website not only showcases the projects I've built, but also marked my transition from JavaScript to TypeScript in frontend development. I refactored older projects into TypeScript and integrated them into this site. As part of this process, I also rewrote legacy CSS styles using Tailwind CSS for consistency and maintainability.
